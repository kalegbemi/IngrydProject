# IngrydProject
my first project on java with ingryd academy.
This program is to connect to a database and create a table
using mysql database management system.
This table will have 5 columns that are to be populated.
for each running of the program it will request for data specific to the columns of the table created
and  will repeat the data request sequence 10 times before ending.
